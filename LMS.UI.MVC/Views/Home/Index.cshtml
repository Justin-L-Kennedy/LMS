                <p>Just Act! Talent Management is designed to help young actors' careers take flight! We provide a skilled staff that will help manage your career in a limitless direction. Not only do we represent talent, but we also provide direction for those who have not yet landed representation. Our nine course regiment includes three or more lessons for aspiring actors to participate in. Upon completion of the course training, actors are invited to partake in a showcase to audition for our management company and will also be awarded an audition for a television show, a commercial, and a stage play regardless of future representation. </p>
                <p>We hope you will join our Just Act! family to begin your path to success. We can't wait to see what the future holds for you! "Wanting to be a good actor is not good enough. You must want to be a great actor. You just have to have that." - Gary Oldman</p>
